# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:
To model and automate ATM and banking system operations using UML diagrams in StarUML.

# SRS (Procedure):
### Step 1: Problem Identification  
Identify the limitations of manual or legacy ATM and banking operations, such as inefficiency, security risks, and limited transaction tracking.

### Step 2: Requirement Analysis  
Define key user roles (Customer, Bank Staff, Admin) and specify main functions like cash withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, account management, and transaction history.

### Step 3: System Design  
Develop UML diagrams (Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Package) in StarUML and design database tables for accounts, transactions, ATMs, and users.
